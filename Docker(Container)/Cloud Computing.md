## Cloud Computing Summary
```
It is a computing technology that allows users to receive IT services through the Internet and mobile at any time, including servers, storage, databases, networks, software, and data analysis used in cloud infrastructure. It provides an environment in which operational costs can be lowered and changes in business requirements can be quickly applied through agile service introduction, flexible expansion and reduction, and automated service maintenance using Agile methodology.

### What is Cloud Computing?
```cloud-computing
Cloud computing is being presented as an infrastructure platform as a data processing platform of the 4th Industrial Revolution.

Cloud Computing(Defined by Gartner)
 └─ A style of computing in which massively scalable IT-enabled capabilities
    are delivered as a service to multiple customer using internet technologies
```

<center>-- utility computing --</center>

``` utility-computing
What computing model is the Cloud Computing based on.

utility computing
 - A form in which IT departments or externel service providers within the enterprise provide customers with management of multiple resources and infrastructure used for computing
 - a pay-as-you-go system that charges according to usage
 - Key features of this tech
   ├─ Cluster
   ├─ Virtualization
   ├─ Partitioning
   ├─ Provisioning
   ├─ Autonomic Computing
   └─ Grid Computing

=> Cloud Computing = Grid Computing + Utility Computing
```

``` features
Cloud Computing Features
 - on demand self-service
   └─ Customers can use the service right away
      without the involvement of an IT service provider
 - broad network access
   └─ Fast access to different client platforms
      using the broadband network provided by each Cloud Service Provider(CSP)
 - rapid elasticity and scalability
   └─ Auto-scaling enables quick expansion and reduction adjustments in minutes
 - resource pooling
   └─ Physically and virtualized resources are managed in pool,
      and are dynamically allocated or reallocated according to user needs
 - measured service
   └─ Costs are incurred through the metering(rate caculation) function 
      in which resource usage is collected in real time

Bring in cloud computing which encludes the above features,
enterprise and customers can create an optimized cloud environment.

### Cloud Computing Architecture
``` 
Cloud Computing Architecture is divided into the physical system layer, virtualiztion layer, and provisioning layer related to **resource utilization** as the lowest layer, and the cloud service management layer and cloud service layer related to **cloud services**.

### Cloud Computing Provision Methods and Types of Cloud Services

<center>-- on-premise --</center>

``` on-premise
Performing IT services by building a data center in the company to store its own data and solutions.
It also includes disadvantages. Increased initial investment costs for all resources(including hardware), and increased ongoing management costs due to limited, inelastic capacity.
```

<center>-- public cloud -- </center>

``` public-cloud
Public cloud mehotd is a method in which multiple users receive cloud resources such as servers and storage from cloud service providers such as AWS, GCP, and Azure thorugh the Internet.
It is utility computer method as mentioned earlier, uses pay-as-you-go system method.
Representative method
 ├─ IaaS
 ├─ PaaS
 └─ SaaS
```

<center>-- private cloud --</center>
```
Cloud service which provides to specific customer or company,
